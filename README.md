RAG model approach
--
This project demonstrates the basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model technique for information retrieval from a vector database and generating AI responses based on the retrieved context. As an example, the RAG model was built using the machine learning book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow." The implementation leverages [Hugging Face's](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/) API with generative AI NLP model and FAISS as the vector database.

This notebook will be updated with best RAG practices.
